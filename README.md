Final Project for intro to Data Science
I have created an app that visualizes coronavirus data in Maryland, stratified by zipcode, counties, and number of hospitalizations
I have decided to choose Maryland as my point of interest as I feel compelled to learn more about the state that I live in, 
and feel more comfortable working with state dataset rather than global ones. 

The data has been extracted from the Maryland Department of Health website https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/
